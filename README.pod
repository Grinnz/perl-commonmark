=head1 Perl bindings for the CommonMark C library

This distribution is a wrapper around I<libcmark>, the official CommonMark C
library.

=head2 Installation of libcmark

Please note that the I<libcmark> API isn't stable yet. This version of the
Perl bindings is targeted at I<libcmark>
L<version 0.24.1|https://github.com/jgm/cmark/releases/tag/0.24.1>.
It's known to work with all releases between 0.21.0 and 0.24.1, but there's
no guarantee that it can be compiled with later versions. Also note that
upgrading libcmark may require recompilation of the Perl distribution.

    curl -LJO https://github.com/jgm/cmark/archive/0.24.1.tar.gz
    tar xzf cmark-0.24.1.tar.gz
    cd cmark-0.24.1
    make [INSTALL_PREFIX=/prefix]
    make test
    make install

See the I<libcmark> README for details.

=head2 Installation from a CPAN tarball

If I<libcmark> is in a standard location:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Otherwise:

    perl Makefile.PL \
        INC="-I/prefix/include" \
        LIBS="-L/prefix/lib -lcmark"
    make
    make test
    make install

See the documentation of I<ExtUtils::MakeMaker> for additional options.
The I<PERL_MM_OPT> environment variable is especially useful.

    export PERL_MM_OPT='INC="-I..." LIBS="-L... -lcmark"'

=head2 Build from a repository checkout 

This distribution uses I<Dist::Zilla> with the external plugins
I<MakeMaker::Awesome> and I<CopyFilesFromBuild>. You can build and test with
I<dzil>:

    dzil test
    dzil build

The files generated by I<Dist::Zilla> are included in the repository,
so you can use the standard build process as well.
